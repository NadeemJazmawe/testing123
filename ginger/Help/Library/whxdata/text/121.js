It maps the ports to connect to the device over USB and manages the remote screen viewer stream from the device to the tool. It receives ","lifecycle events from the USB library such as device connected or device disconnected, Agent finished installing, and Agent started. It transfers these events to the UFT Mobile server for adding the device to the pool. The connector is also responsible for installing and uninstalling apps on the device."," ","Test devices accessed via connectors"," ","These are the devices (smartphones/tablets) on which the tests are run.
